# 🌦️ Weather Prediction Chatbot with RAG  
 
A **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Chatbot** that provides not just raw weather data, but **actionable, human-like advice**. It combines live weather updates with semantic search and a large language model to help users make better daily decisions — like whether to carry an umbrella, plan outdoor activities, or adjust travel schedules.

## 📄 How It Works  



1. User submits a query (e.g., *“Should I carry an umbrella tomorrow in Hyderabad?”*).  



2. Weather data is fetched in real-time from the **OpenWeather API**.  



3. Query + weather info are embedded using **MiniLM**.  



4. **FAISS** retrieves the most relevant vectors.  



5. **Gemini 2.5 Flash** generates a simple, context-aware recommendation.  



6. Response is displayed instantly in the **Gradio UI**.  
 
✅ Example:  



*User:* “Should I carry an umbrella tomorrow?”  



*Bot:* “Given the light to moderate rain and significant rainfall (29.9mm), it is recommended to carry an umbrella or a raincoat.”
